Woke up feeling drained. FIFA night was fun, but now I’m paying for it.

Grabbed a quick coffee and a granola bar. Nothing new there.

Checked emails while walking to class. OS exam reminder. Stress instantly doubled.

OS lecture. Professor covered memory management, but I barely absorbed anything.

Break time. Thought about reviewing notes. Ended up scrolling my phone instead.

Software Engineering class. The professor talked about project deadlines. Not what I wanted to hear.

Lunch with friends. Everyone's talking about weekend plans. My weekend is just going to be study sessions.

Library session. Finally opened my OS notes, but my brain wasn’t cooperating.

2025-02-08 15:30:00
Group project meeting. Another reminder that we’re behind.

2025-02-08 16:30:00
Checked my email. Another missed notification from my guitar instructor. That hobby is officially dead.

2025-02-08 17:00:00
Networking lecture. My brain completely shut off halfway through.

2025-02-08 18:30:00
I told myself I’d go to the gym today. Didn’t even pretend to try this time.

2025-02-08 19:00:00
Dinner. Instant noodles again. At this point, it’s tradition.

2025-02-08 19:30:00
Attempted to study for OS. Instead, I sat at my desk, staring at my screen.

2025-02-08 21:00:00
Called my parents. They could tell I was stressed. They told me to take breaks. If only.

2025-02-08 22:30:00
Roommate asked if I wanted to play FIFA again. Had to say no.

2025-02-08 23:30:00
Finally forcing myself to sleep. Tomorrow is Friday, and the grind continues.
